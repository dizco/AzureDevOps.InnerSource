# AzureDevOps.InnerSource ðŸŒŸ

Discoverability of [InnerSource](https://innersourcecommons.org/) repositories on Azure DevOps suffers from a few limitations compared to Github. For example, it is very difficult to find and to assess how mature a repository is. This project provides the following features:
- Aggregated view of all repositories within a project
- Badge to display the last commit date in a repository
- Badge to display the main programming language used in a repository
- Ability to "star" any Azure DevOps repository within an organization and display the number of stars with a badge
